[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

## _Reactive Spring WebFlux API + Real-time React_

This is written as microservice API for managing films using the event sourcing pattern of microservice.

Prerequisites: 
- Java 8
- ReactJS
- ✨Maven
## Features

- Add a film service using POST reactive API
- Get a film by slug
- Get All the films
- Add notifications via web-sockets whenever a new film is added

## Tech

The example uses a number of tech as follows:

- [React.js] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [Java 11] - Backend
- [springboot reactive framework] - Reactive framework from spring 
- [npm] - run the frontend build
- [maven] - build tool for backend
- [EXT JS](https://www.sencha.com) - To power React JS
- [HTML and JS] - duh


## Installation

This service requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+  [Java ](https://www.oracle.com/ae/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)v11+, [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org) to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh 
git clone https://github.com/satyadeepsingh/vox-cinemas-service.git
git checkout react-app
cd vox-cinemas-service
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
The data migration will create 3 film entries for us to test.

For frontend environments...

```sh
cd react-app
npm run start
```
